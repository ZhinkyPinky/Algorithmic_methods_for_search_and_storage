in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god
and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand
he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still
and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be
i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
